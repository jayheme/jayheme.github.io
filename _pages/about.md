About me
======
I am currently a Research Scientist in the Quantum Science and Technology lab at Physical Research Laboratory, India. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Engineering Physics and a Master’s degree in Optical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST). My primary research interest is the field of experimental quantum information.

My current research focus is on the generation of entangled photons across various degrees of freedom and their application in quantum information tasks, particularly in quantum communication. I have previously worked on demonstrating various quantum key distribution experiments over a 200m free-space link. During my Master's thesis, I worked on quantum-enhanced interferometry, researching methods to improve the sensitivity of interferometers with quantum states of light.
